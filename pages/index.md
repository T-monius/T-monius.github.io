I'm a software engineer hanging out in Denver, CO until I can safely relocate to NYC, NY. I'm the proud co-creator of [Maestro](https://maestro-framework.github.io/ "Maestro") which is a serverless framework for rapidly iterating serverless workflows.

I'm skilled with JavaScript, Node.js, React/Redux, Ruby, Rails, SQL, and AWS. You can check out some of my other experience and see my skills on my [resume](../assets/docs/torrel_moseley_resume.pdf "Resume").
